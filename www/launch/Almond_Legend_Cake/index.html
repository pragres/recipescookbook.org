					<p style="font-family: Arial; text-align: justify;">Dear family and fellows:</p>

					<p style="font-family: Arial; text-align: justify;">From immemorial times the almond is considered a symbol of love, wealth and happiness. Believed connected with the Greek culture, the legend tells Princess Phyllis was turned into an almond tree by the Gods, after she die of sadness, waiting for her loved Demophon returns to marry her. Perhaps because the legend, almonds are currently presented at weddings, festivals and special events as a symbol of prosperity and union.</p>

					<p style="font-family: Arial; text-align: justify;">The almonds’ pleasant aroma and unusual taste makes them one of the most consumed seed, with high popularity in the world of international pastry. The Almond Legend Cake delights our palate by combining the sweetness with the lighter, bitter flavor of the almond oil. The sugared cover is made in synonymous of the deeper love and the almond inside represents the eternal spirit of youthful impetuosity.</p>

					<p style="font-family: Arial; text-align: justify;">Prepare this cake following the advice given: one single almond seed should be included intact. Odds numbers symbolize fortune and luck. When the cake is divided, the person who gets the almond is supposed to be blessed with great joy and happiness.</p>
