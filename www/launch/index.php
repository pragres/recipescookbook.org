					<p style="font-family: Arial; text-align: justify;">Dear family and fellows:</p>
					<p style="font-family: Arial; text-align: justify;">We are pretty excited about bringing out our very new website, and that mood involves you too. Mirta Recipes Cookbook<sup style="font-size: small;">TM</sup> is a collection of culinary secrets, acquired by my Grandma throughout a lifetime of cooking for multiple generations. My family and I started this project to share the hundreds of recipes my Grandma compiled for her loves ones. The dishes you will find here are convenient to prepare and delightful. We also provide tips that, no matter your experience, may help improve your cooking skills. There is a high probability you will find a new favorite recipe here.</p>
					<p style="font-family: Arial; text-align: justify;">Also, this is not just a static release but a project in continuous development. As of now, we have a very decent amount of recipes to browse through and since my Grandma loves to cook, this number is increasing each week.</p>
					<p style="font-family: Arial; text-align: justify;">We invite you to follow us at <a target="_blank" href="http://recipescookbook.org/?utm_source=pragres&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=launch">recipescookbook.org</a>! Hoping to see you there:</p>
