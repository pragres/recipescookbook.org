						A vase of flowers in a window frame.<br/>
						A house of gentle light amid dark leaves.<br/>
						An ecstasy so sharp it feels like anguish,<br/>
						The pull that makes our beeline an ellipse.<br/><br/>

						No transcendental morning's inspiration<br/>
						So ravishes the things we never see.<br/>
						We hear for all our lives a silent music<br/>
						To which we dance unknowing through our time.<br/><br/>

						And even when we die, there is a beauty<br/>
						Older than the cold December stars,<br/>
						A part of us that waits behind the darkness<br/>
						To take us once again into its arms.<br/><br/>

					<p style="font-family: Arial; text-align: justify;">Dear family and fellows:</p>

					<p style="font-family: Arial; text-align: justify;">
						Mothers Day is like a global extra birthday that Moms (and grandmother, and great-grandmother and so on) gain only for the privilege of giving birth; and we are happy to celebrate with you bringing a new tasty recipe that everybody at home can enjoy. Risotto is an Italian dish invented in the far Renaissance era and today continues being a delicate preference of many. In such special day we are pleased to transport it you to your table in the same way centuries ago was used for celebrating festive occasions and holidays.<br/><br/>

						The Cuban tradition states that mothers, in their day, should be released from their daily obligations and dads and sons should take responsibility over the house. Since the day is always Sunday man have to fulfill; and that is just another good reason to put over the newest tablecloth this warm, scrumptious dish: Risotto may be difficult to pronounce, but it is extremely easy to prepare, not to saying elegant and traditional.<br/><br/>

						We hope you enjoy this celebration next to your loved ones. Prepare this plate at home and be part of the selected ones who lived the millenary experience of tasting this exceptional rice.
