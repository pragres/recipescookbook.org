<h2>About me and these recipes</h2>

<p>Some of the recipes you will find here have been collected from magazines or cookbooks I have found and enjoyed over the years. As any cook or baker would do, I have made these recipes my own; they are like family. A select few of the recipes are also family treasures that have been passed down through the generations.</p>

<p>At heart, I am a baker and enjoy preparing desserts the most.</p>

<p>I would like to take a moment and give thanks to my dear friend, Hilda Diaz, who was so kind as to share some of her secrets with me. She gave me hints for how to develop other varieties of desserts, including cakes and helped me refine the art of decorating them. On this page, as a tribute to her, I offer salad and rice recipes that hail from her kitchen. I hope you enjoy them as we do because they are... simply scrumptious.</p>
