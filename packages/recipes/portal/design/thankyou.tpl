<h2>{$title}</h2>
<p style="font-family: sans-serif; margin: 0px 10px 0px 0px; text-align: justify;">Again, thanks for downloading my book. This book, even short, is the result of years of research and weeks of dedication and
effort by my entire family. It is hard to imagine all the complexity behind making a printable, even a short one. Days organizing, setting time apart,
checking designs, choosing colors, writing, revising were needed in order to make this book came to the light; all those are worth it only if you
enjoy the recipes mentioned here. Do not hesitate to contact me with questions, suggestions, or just to say hi. I would love to hear back from you.</p>

<p style="font-family: sans-serif;">
	Best,<br/>
